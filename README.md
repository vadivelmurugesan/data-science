# Data Science
## Introduction

* Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.
* The data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
* Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data.â€¯

## Fundamental Libraries of Python for Data Science

### Pandas

Powerful for working with structured data, including data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### NumPy

Essential for numerical computations and array manipulation.


## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are appropriately named, as they provide insights into the main features of our data.  

### Central Tendency

* Mean - Average
* Median - Middle Value
* Mode - Most Frequently Occuring Value

### Measures of Dispersion (Variability)

The most common way to gauge the variability is via Standard Deviation

#### Standard Deviation

Measures how much the values in the dataset vary around the mean.

Super low standard deviation indicates a dataset with values clustered around the mean, while a higher standard deviation represents a wider spread around the mean
