# Data Science ["Content making is in-progress]
## Introduction

* Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.
* The data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
* Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data.â€¯

## Methodologies

A Methodology is a system of methods and a guideline to decision making during the scientific process.

Data science methodology guides the datascientis in solving complex problems with data.

### Data methodology stages

* Business understanding
    - What is the problem you are trying to solve?
* Analytic Approach
    - How can you use data to answer the question?
        - If the question is to determine the probabilities of an action, then use a predictive model
        - If the question is to show the relationships, then use a descriptive model
        - If the question requires a yes or no answer, then use a classification model
* Data Requirements
* Data Collection
    - Idenify and gather available data sources (These can be in the form of structured, unstructured, and even semi-structured data relevant to the problem domain.)
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
* Feedback

#### Analytic Approach

**Based On Queuestions**

1. Descriptive Questions: What is current status?
2. Diagonistic Questions: Why did it happen?
3. Predictive Questions: What likely to happen?
4. Prescriptive Questions: What should we do?
5. Classification Questions: What category does this belong to?

## Fundamental Libraries of Python for Data Science

### Pandas

Powerful for working with structured data, including data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### NumPy

Essential for numerical computations and array manipulation.


## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are appropriately named, as they provide insights into the main features of our data.  

### Central Tendency

* Mean - Average
* Median - Middle Value
* Mode - Most Frequently Occuring Value

### Measures of Dispersion (Variability)

The most common way to gauge the variability is via Standard Deviation

#### Standard Deviation

Measures how much the values in the dataset vary around the mean.

Super low standard deviation indicates a dataset with values clustered around the mean, while a higher standard deviation represents a wider spread around the mean
