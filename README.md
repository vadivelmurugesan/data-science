# Data Science
## Introduction

* Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.
* The data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
* Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data.â€¯

## Methodologies

A Methodology is a system of methods and a guideline to decision making during the scientific process.

Data science methodology guides the datascientis in solving complex problems with data.

### Data methodology stages

Foundational methodology, a cyclical, iterative data science methodology developed by John Rollins, consists of 10 stages.

* Business understanding
    - What is the problem you are trying to solve?
    - Understand the business problem and determine the data needed to answer the core business question. 
* Analytic Approach
    - How can you use data to answer the question?
        - If the question is to determine the probabilities of an action, then use a predictive model
        - If the question is to show the relationships, then use a descriptive model
        - If the question requires a yes or no answer, then use a classification model
* Data Requirements
    - Identify the correct and necessary data content, formats, and sources needed for the specific analytical approach.
* Data Collection
    - Idenify and gather available data sources (These can be in the form of structured, unstructured, and even semi-structured data relevant to the problem domain.)
* Data Understanding
    - Focused on exploring and analyzing the collected data to ensure that the data is representative of the problem to be solved.
* Data Preparation
    - Where data is cleaned, transformed, and formatted for further analysis, including feature engineering and text analysis.
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
* Feedback

### CRISP - DM Methodology

* CRISP - DM stands for cross industry standard process for data mining
* CRISP-DM, an open source data methodology, combines several data-related methodology stages into one stage and omits the Feedback stage resulting in a six-stage data methodology.
    1. Business Understanding
    2. Data Understanding [Combination of Data Requirements, Collection and Understanding]
    3. Data Preparation
    4. Modeling
    5. Evaluation
    6. Deployment


#### Analytic Approach

**Based On Queuestions**

1. Descriptive Questions: What is current status?
2. Diagonistic Questions: Why did it happen?
3. Predictive Questions: What likely to happen?
4. Prescriptive Questions: What should we do?
5. Classification Questions: What category does this belong to?

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are appropriately named, as they provide insights into the main features of our data.  

### Central Tendency

* Mean - Average
* Median - Middle Value
* Mode - Most Frequently Occuring Value

### Measures of Dispersion (Variability)

The most common way to gauge the variability is via Standard Deviation

#### Standard Deviation

Measures how much the values in the dataset vary around the mean.

Super low standard deviation indicates a dataset with values clustered around the mean, while a higher standard deviation represents a wider spread around the mean
